    <h1>Non-Academic Interests</h1>
    <p>Wow, ok! I think it is very important to have hobbies outside of work, because it's good to flex your brain in a variety of ways.</p>

    <p>I occasionally dabble in painting, some pictures below.</p>

    <p>I also occasionally dabble in fiber crafts.</p>

    <p>I make my own shirts! </p>

    <p>And I read, like, a lot. Mostly scifi and fantasy, but I occasionally branch out to science history and other non-fiction.</p>
