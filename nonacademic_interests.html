    <h1>Non-Academic Interests</h1>
    <p>Wow, ok! I think it is very important to have hobbies outside of work, because it's good to flex your brain in a variety of ways.</p>

    <p>I occasionally dabble in painting, some pictures below. </p>

    <p>I also occasionally dabble in fiber crafts. I've done some embroidery, needlepoint, and a large amount of knitting. </p>

    <p>I make my own shirts! All of the fun button up T-shirts I wear have been at least modified or fully generated by myself.</p>

    <p>And I read, like, a lot. Mostly scifi and fantasy, but I occasionally branch out to science history and other non-fiction. Some books I would highly recommend are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Science history:
        <ul>
          <li>The Glass Universe
            <ul>
              <li>A phenomenal history of the Harvard Computers that I think every astronomer should read, particularly the ones that pass through the Center for Astrophysics.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Chasing Venus: the Race to Measure the Heavens
            <ul>
              <li>Ever wonder how astronomers measured the astronomical unit? This book outlines the wild stories from the planet-wide effort to observe the 1761 and 1769 transits of Venus. This endeavor is arguably the first international collaboration, and it comes with exactly the trials and tribulations one may expect from such a groundbreaking project.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sci-fi:
        <ul>
          <li>The Murderbot Diaries
            <ul>
              <li>Don't let the name turn you off; the Murderbot Diaries are fantastic science fiction that explore person-hood and autonomy in a hyper-capitalist future. Plus the eponymous SecUnit is a very relatable narrator.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A Memory Called Empire
            <ul>
              <li>Wonderful world building, with interesting explorations of how small polities interact with large expansionist empires. And the second book (A Desolation Called Peace) has a very interesting take on first contact.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fantasy:
        <ul>
          <li>Tress and the Emerald Sea
            <ul>
              <li>An absolutely delightful stand alone romp. It has pirates! It has a dragon! It has a talking rat! Very fun. I like a lot of Brandon Sanderson, but I will admit that at he is not for everyone and I can't in good conscience recommend the Stormlight Archive to a first time reader (each book is easily over 1000 pages).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Discworld
            <ul>
              <li>I mean, it's Terry Pratchett! But seriously, the entirety of the Discworld series are wonderful. I highly recommend starting with Monsterous Regiment, but depending on what you find interesting one might start with the Witches Series (a deconstruction of the classical three witches archetype), the City Watch Series (explore the city dynamics of an industrial revolution, and the changing relationship between the population and justice) or the Academicals Series (for a scathing and very true deconstruction of academia).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
